# Dirac-Equation-Synchronization-Dynamics
Codes relevant to the paper titled "Designing topological cluster synchronization patterns with the Dirac operator".

DS_Dynamics1s.m: runs the dynamics and does a sweep of values of the coupling strength sigma. Uses random initial conditions.
DS_Dynamics1t.m: runs the dynmaics for a fixed strength of sigma. Uses random initial conditions.
DS_Dynamics2s.m: same as DS_Dynamics1s.m but uses an initial condition that is close to the selected eigenstate. This code is used for the stability analysis.
DS_Dynamics2t.m: same as DS_Dynamics1t.m but uses an initial condition that is close to the selected eigenstate. This code is used for the stability analysis.
